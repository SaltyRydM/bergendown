# Scientific environment

This is where you write the name of the subject/professional milieu involved in the study, faculty(faculties)/institute(s)/centre(s)/research groups/school of research.

Contractual joint venture partners should also be mentioned here. If these are represented by graphic symbols (logo etc.) they should be included on this page.

NB! Most organisations have guidelines concerning the use of their logo. These guidelines regulate \underline{who} can use the logo, \underline{when} the logo can be used and \underline{how}. This is quite relevant when a logo is used together with information connected to other institutions/organisations. (A typical example would be rules concerning space between other written or graphic content.)

Remember to find out which guidelines apply and ensure that they are followed!

Most organisations will be able to provide a digital version of their logo in a suitable format. Pip pip makaroni
